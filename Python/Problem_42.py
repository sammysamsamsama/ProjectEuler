# Coded triangle numbers
#
# The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t_n = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
#
# 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
#
# By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical
# position and adding these values we form a word value.
# For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_10.
# If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
#
# Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
# a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
